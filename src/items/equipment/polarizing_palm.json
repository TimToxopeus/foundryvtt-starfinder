As long as you aren’t holding or wielding an item in that hand, you can use it as a standard action to make a melee attack roll against a target’s EAC. If you hit, a technological item that target is holding or wearing in a visible, accessible manner (such as on a belt) or a weapon that is powered by a battery that target is wielding loses 1d6+1 charges. This amount is doubled if you score a critical hit.</p>",
