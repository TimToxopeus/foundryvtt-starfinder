For more on anassanoi culture and their city of Kahlannal.<br><br>The typical anassanoi is staunchly loyal, sympathetic, and effusive with friends. However, by human standards, anassanoi body language and facial expressions lack animation and emotion, despite the fact that an anassnoi has three eyes and two (vertical) mouths. Anassanois are natural telepaths and extremely open when communicating with telepathy, suffusing such exchanges with the feelings their physical gestures lack. This openness translates into emotional honesty, offering others a ready sense of who the speaking anassanoi is. An anassanoi who wants to avoid this openness can learn to suppress it by becoming practiced in deception, but few anassanois do so.<br><br>A typical anassanoi stands almost 8 feet tall but is slender, weighing around 200 pounds. They mature at about age 25 and live for around 150 years.<br><br><strong>Ability Modifiers</strong> +2 Wis, +2 Cha, â€“2 Con<br><strong>Hit Points</strong> 4</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Size and Type</h2>\n<p>Anassanois are Medium humanoids with the anassanoi subtype.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Blindsense</h2>\n<p>Anassanois can sense thinking creatures with a range of 30 feet.
