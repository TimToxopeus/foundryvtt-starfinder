Yet through wit and technological prowess, theyâ€™ve spread throughout the solar system, giving truth to the old adage that every starship needs a few rats.</p>\n<h2>Size and Type</h2>\n<p>Ysoki are Small humanoids with the ysoki subtype.</p>\n<h2>Cheek Pouches</h2>\n<p>Ysoki can store up to 1 cubic foot of items weighing up to 1 bulk in total in their cheek pouches, and they can transfer a single object between hand and cheek as a swift action. A ysoki can disgorge the entire contents of his pouch onto the ground in his square as a move action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity.</p>\n<h2>Darkvision</h2>\n<p>Ysoki can see up to 60 feet in the dark. See page 263 for more information.</p>\n<h2>Moxie</h2>\n<p>Ysoki are scrappy and nimble even when the odds are against them. A ysoki can stand from prone as a swift action. Additionally, when off-kilter (see page 276), a ysoki does not take the normal penalties to attacks or gain the flat-footed condition. When attempting an Acrobatics check to tumble through the space of an opponent at least one size category larger than himself, a ysoki receive a +5 racial bonus to the check.</p>\n<h2>Scrounger</h2>\n<p>Ysoki receive a +2 racial bonus to Engineering, Stealth, and Survival checks.</p>",
