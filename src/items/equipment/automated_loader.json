You can activate the automated loader as a move action to reload or recharge a weapon that’s mounted to the powered armor (but not to replace the batteries of the powered armor itself). Abilities that let you reload faster than a move action don’t apply to an automated loader.<br>This upgrade can be installed only in powered armor.</p>",
