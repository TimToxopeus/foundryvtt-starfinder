      "value": "<p>Idealized by many other humanoid races and gifted with innate psychic abilities, lashuntas are at once consummate scholars and enlightened warriors, naturally divided into two specialized subraces with different abilities and societal roles.</p>\n<h2>Size and Type</h2>\n<p>Lashuntas are Medium humanoids with the lashunta subtype.</p>\n<h2>Dimorphic</h2>\n<p>All lashuntas gain +2 Charisma at character creation. Korasha lashuntas are muscular (+2 Strength at character creation) but often brash and unobservant (-2 Wisdom at character creation). Damaya lashuntas are typically clever and well-spoken (+2 Intelligence at character creation) but somewhat delicate (-2 Constitution at character creation).</p>\n<h2>Lashunta Magic</h2>\n<p>Lashuntas gain the following spell-like abilities:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>At will:</strong> <em>daze, psychokinetic hand</em></li>\n<li><strong>1/day:</strong> <em>detect thoughts.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>See Spell-like Abilities on page 262. The caster level for these effects is equal to the lashuntaâ€™s level.</p>\n<h2>Limited Telepathy</h2>\n<p>Lashuntas can mentally communicate with any creatures within 30 feet with whom they share a language. Conversing telepathically with multiple creatures simultaneously is just as difficult as listening to multiple people speaking.</p>\n<h2>Student</h2>\n<p>Lashuntas love to learn, and they receive a +2 racial bonus to any two skills of their choice.</p>",
