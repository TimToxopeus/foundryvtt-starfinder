      "value": "<p>By injecting a colony of glowing nanites into the skin of one of your palms, you gain the ability to thwart stealthy foes. As a standard action, you can touch a creature (usually requiring a melee attack against EAC) to transfer some of your glowing nanites to it. For the next 5 minutes, the affected creature glows softly; it takes a –20 penalty to Stealth checks and is unable to benefit from the concealment usually provided by darkness. If the affected creature turns invisible while it is glowing, any others within line of sight of it are aware of its location. Once you use your limning palm, you can’t use it again until you’ve rested for 10 minutes to regain Stamina Points.</p>",
