      "value": "<p>This set of mechanical supports and electric connectors allows you to install a single technological item with light or negligible bulk on your wrist or another easily accessible body part. Installing or swapping out a technological item attached to the upgrade requires 10 minutes, as though you were swapping out an armor upgrade. Whenever at least one of your hands is free, you can use the item as though it were in your hand. If the item normally requires two hands to use, you still need two free hands to use it.</p>",
