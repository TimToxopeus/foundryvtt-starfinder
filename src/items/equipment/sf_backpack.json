People assume most <em>SF backpacks</em> come from the Lorespire Complex on Absalom Station, but more knock-offs exist than authentic ones.<br /></span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListMagicItems_ctl00_LabelName\">While wearing a <em>SF backpack</em>, treat your Strength score as 4 higher for determining your carrying capacity. This increase doesn&rsquo;t stack with other backpacks. When you seek an object stowed in the backpack, you find it immediately, allowing you to retrieve the object as if you were drawing a weapon. In addition, you can stow objects of 1 bulk or less in the pack as if you were sheathing a weapon.</span></p>",
