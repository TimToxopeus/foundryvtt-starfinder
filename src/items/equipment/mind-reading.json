When you score a critical hit using a weapon with the mind-reading fusion, you automatically read the surface thoughts of the creature struck. This is a mind-affecting ability. If the weapon already has a critical hit effect, when you score a critical hit, you can apply either the weapon&rsquo;s normal critical hit effect or the mind-reading effect.</p>",
