While their multiple arms increase the number of items they can have at the ready, it doesnâ€™t increase the number of attacks they can make during combat.</p>\n<h2>Historian</h2>\n<p>Due to their in-depth historical training and the wide-ranging academic background knowledge they possess, kasathas receive a +2 racial bonus to Culture checks.</p>\n<h2>Natural Grace</h2>\n<p>Kasathas receive a +2 racial bonus to Acrobatics and Athletics checks.</p>",
