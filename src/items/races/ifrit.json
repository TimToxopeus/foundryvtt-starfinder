Once per day, an ifrit making an attack that deals fire damage can roll a single attack roll twice and use the higher result.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Fire Resistance</h2>\n<p>The supernatural fire in ifrit blood grants them resistance 5 to fire. </p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Spell-Like Ability</h2>\n<p>Once per day, an ifrit can cast overheat as a spell-like ability. At 8th level, he can use this ability one additional time per day, and he gains a third use per day at 16th level. His caster level equals his level, and the save DC is equal to 11 + his Charisma modifier.</p>",
