      "value": "<p>A linguistic capacitor is a microscopic data chip inserted into your brain and connected by artificial synapses to your brain’s language centers. Once per day as a full action, you can activate a linguistic capacitor to gain the ability to communicate via the spoken or signed language of any intelligent creature, whether it is a racial tongue or a regional dialect, for 1 hour. You gain only one language at a time, and you can’t communicate with creatures whose method of communication is other something other than a spoken or signed language. You can make yourself understood as far as your voice carries.</p>",
