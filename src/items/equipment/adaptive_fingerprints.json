You leave no identifying fingerprints behind when touching an object or surface, and you can’t be identified through your fingerprints. In addition, if you have access to records of another individual’s fingerprints, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to create wrinkled patterns in the pads that mimic those fingerprints for 1 hour, allowing you to bypass security features or leave false evidence.</p>",
